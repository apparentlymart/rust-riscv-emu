The files in this directory are initial memory images for RV32 test programs
that expect to be loaded at address 0x80000000 and execution started with
the PC also set to 0x80000000.

Each one reserves a portion of memory to write results into. After execution
completes (signalled with an ecall instruction), the results area must match
the reference values in the ".want" file given alongside each ".bin".

------

You can inspect the equivalent assembly for one of the binary files in here
by running objdump, like this:
    riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -b binary -m riscv --adjust-vma=0x80000000 -D tests/rv32cases/MUL.bin

These images include the reserved space for the output signatures, initialized
as 0xffffffff. Therefore the end of the disassembly will appear to include this
sort of garbage after the terminal "ecall", which you can ignore.
